This trip we went to Vieques, another big islands in Puerto Rico. We shared Uber with our roommate in Airbnb, they are a couple name Victor and Maria (Victor from Germany and Maria from Venezuela)

We took Uber to Fajardo and took ferry from Fajardo to the island. It takes around 2 hours. Vieques is bigger than Culebra and it not that popular as Culebra. However, Vieques has Bioluminescent bay at Playa Mosquito, also has a black-sand beach (Playa Negra is containing minute particles of lava)

This time we went to the island around the evening. After we arrival, we took taxi to Sun Bay campground ($3 per person) and we camped there and we paid $10 per night.

Tip…If someone don’t wanna pay for the campground, you can camp at the beach next to the campground. They don’t have water which means you need to carry your water and food.

After we swam in Sun Bay, we walked around to see the sun set…So beautiful. We went to sleep even not that comfy, but that’s okay.

Morning, we walked to Esperanza town. We went to bakery shop for breakfast and walked to Playa Negra – the black beach. During the way, we saw a lot of horses. This island is very popular about wild horses. It is very cool.

At the Playa Negra, we swam and took around 1 hour there. We played sand and have a great time there. I think it a very nice beach.

The next beach that we went to is the Playa Caracas. It’s requested from the Venezuela girl because the capital city in Venezuela is Caracas. She wanted to take a picture with the sign.

Be honest, we didn’t go to Playa Mosquito because we went there when it full moon and we cannot see the bioluminescent when it too bright.

We had the campfire at the last night and you know what? Off spray can help you set the fire! One last thing that we learned, we learned to hitch hike and it not that scary. People who picked us up they are so cool and they have a cool story to tell us. We might try it in the future who know…

The end.
